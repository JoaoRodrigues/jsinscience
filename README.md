# JavaScript Web Apps in Science

JavaScript is gaining traction in the scientific community as a simple and powerful language
to build engaging and interactive applications running only on the web browser. 

This page is a repository of simple examples that attempt to illustrate the potential of 'web apps'.
Click on the title of each example to see a live demo, or browse the repository for the code.

# List of Examples

## [Principal Component Analysis](pca/index.html)
Implementation of PCA for simple inspection of similarities and differences among complex datasets. Uses
the [LALOlib](http://mlweb.loria.fr/lalolab/lalolib.html) library for PCA and 
[Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) for plotting.

## [Circular Dichroism of Proteins](circular-dichroism/index.html)
Tool to fit and simulate circular dichroism spectra of proteins. 
Pure JavaScript implementation of the algorithm described in this 
[publication](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed200060t)

## [Entrez API](entrez-api/index.html)
Very simple examples of retrieving records from PubMed from keywords and/or authors, using
